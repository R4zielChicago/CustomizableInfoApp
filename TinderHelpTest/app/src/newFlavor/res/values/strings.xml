    <string name="subject_0_subTitle">"An Overview"</string>

    <string name="subject_0_description_tv">"Basketball is a team sport. Two teams of five players each try"
        "to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground. The game is "
        "played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end. The court "
        "is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line. If the offensive team puts the ball "
        "into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court "
        "line. If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball. Once the offensive team gets the ball "
        "over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area in back "
        "of the line. If it does, the defense is awarded the ball. The ball is moved down the court "
        "toward the basket by passing or dribbling. The team with the ball is called the offense. "
        "The team without the ball is called the defense. They try to steal the ball, contest shots, "
        "steal and deflect passes, and garner rebounds.
        \n\nWhen a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team. "
        "If a basket, or field goal, is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is "
        "worth three points. A free throw is worth one point. Free throws are awarded to a team "
        "according to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type "
        "of foul committed. Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded "
        "the shooter, depending upon where he was when he shot. If he was beyond the three-point "
        "line, then he gets three shots. Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being "
        "awarded until a certain number have accumulated during a half. Once that number is reached, "
        "then the player who was fouled is awarded a '1-and-1' opportunity. If he makes his first "
        "free throw, he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live on "
        "the rebound.
        \n\nEach game is divided into sections. All levels have two halves. In college, each half is "
        "twenty minutes long. In high school and below, the halves are divided into eight "
        "(and sometimes, six) minute quarters. In the pros, quarters are twelve minutes long. There "
        "is a gap of several minutes between halves. Gaps between quarters are relatively short. If "
        "the score is tied at the end of regulation, then overtime periods of various lengths are "
        "played until a winner emerges.
        \n\nEach team is assigned a basket or goal to defend. This means that the other basket is "
        "their scoring basket. At halftime, the teams switch goals. The game begins with one player "
        "from either team at center court. A referee will toss the ball up between the two. The "
        "player that gets his hands on the ball will tip it to a teammate. This is called a tip-off. "
        "In addition to stealing the ball from an opposing player, there are other ways for a team "
        "to get the ball."</string>

    <string name="subject_1_title_tv">"SHOOTING:"</string>
    <string name="subject_1_subTitle">"Stationary Basketball Shooting Form and Technique"</string>
    <string name="subject_1_description_tv">"In this section, we give you the raw form and mechanics"
        "of stationary shooting. In other words, this section does NOT address the fundamentals of "
        "shooting on the move and more advanced footwork you'll need for game situations.
        \nHere's a quick roadmap of the stationary shooting fundamentals that we'll be covering:
        \nEyes on Target
        \nStance and Balance
        \nShot Pocket
        \nGrip
        \nBalance
        \nHand Delivery
        \nUpforce and Landing
        \nFollow Through
        \nCorrect Shot
        \n\nEYES ON TARGET
        \nTo improve accuracy, locate the target (rim) as early as possible.
        \nKeep your eyes on the target and do not follow the flight of the ball.
        \nKeeping your target focus is very important!
        \nSTANCE AND BALANCE
        \nFeet are shoulder width apart for good balance.
        \nFeet should be in a slightly staggered stance that is consistent and comfortable for you. "
        "Your shooting foot is slightly ahead of the non-shooting foot in a comfortable position.
        \nPoint your feet in the general direction of the basket, but not necessarily directly at "
        "it. We prefer an open stance, but you can also use the closed (squared) stance if that's "
        "more comfortable for you. With an open stance, your feet point towards one side of the "
        "basket. For example, a right handed shooter will point his or her feet just to the left of "
        "the rim for a more natural position and shooting motion.
        \nOnce you develop a comfortable stance, line up your feet the exact same way on every "
        "shot. Whatever stance you use, consistency is critical.
        \nFlex/bend your knees on every shot.
        \nSHOT POCKET
        \nAs you catch the ball, move it quickly into the shot pocket.
        \nLine everything up so the ball and your shooting eye form a straight line to the basket. This is VERY important.
        \nPosition the ball several inches above your waist.
        \nGrip the ball properly and be ready to shoot.
        \nPosition the ball in your shot pocket the SAME way every time you catch it.
        \nGRIP
        \nPlace the air hole between the middle and index fingers.
        \nLine up your fingertip pads parallel to the long seams of the ball, so you can monitor "
        "the back spin.
        \nLeave space between the ball and the middle of your palm. You should be able to insert "
        "a pencil between the ball and your palm area.
        \nSpread your fingers far enough apart to comfortably balance the ball in one hand.
        \nThe ball should sit on your finger pads.
        \nBALANCE HAND
        \nYour non-shooting hand should be on the side of the ball.
        \nYour balance hand should not add force or spin to the shot.
        \nshooting-fund-balance-hand1 (13K)
        \nYour non-shooting hand should not move on delivery and should ALWAYS come off the ball "
        "FIRST.
        \nDELIVERY
        \nThe ball should start motion directly upwards from the shot pocket.
        \nYour elbow should be positioned comfortably under the ball.
        \nThe ball stays in front of you and should not go behind your head.
        \nUncoil your body with your legs, core, and arm power all coordinated.
        \nYour elbow and wrist should extend in a straight line to the basket.
        Your shooting hand should extend in a straight line to the rim.
        \nHand position on delivery is very important. The ball should come off the hand with "
        "perfect symmetrical backspin.
        \nAs shown in the picture to the right, your guide hand stays to the side and does not "
        "influence the flight of the ball.
        \nUPFORCE AND LANDING
        \nRelease the ball on the way up, just before the top of your jump.
        \nUse your legs to generate upforce.
        \nYou should land in the same spot that you jumped, which shows that you have good "
        "balance on your shot.
        \nFOLLOW-THROUGH
        \nYour wrists should be floppy (relaxed).
        \nFingers should be pointed at the target (rim).
        \nFinish high. You should see your fingers at the top square of the back board.
        \nHold your follow through position until the ball hits the rim."</string>

    <string name="subject_2_title_tv">"PASSING:"</string>
    <string name="subject_2_subTitle">"The Lost Art"</string>

    <string name="subject_2_description_tv">"Basketball is a team game. By definition, that means "
        "all players are involved with the process of playing the game and should function as one. "
        "One of the primary skills created to accomplish this is passing. Yet, passing remains one "
        "of the most under-taught, under-emphasized, and under drilled skill in the game!!
        \nPlayers assume the values that the coach places on each aspect of the game. When teaching "
        "passing it is important that the coach teach not only the skill, but the mentality as well. "
        "Too many players think of passing as something to do when they don't have a shot as opposed "
        "to an unselfish act that is designed to include other players.
        \nWhen teaching younger players, be aware of their physical and mental limitations. Young "
        "players usually lack the strength necessary to make the plays that they believe can be "
        "successful (like the ones they see on television) and they are still developing their sense "
        "of space and time. In addition, their recognition skills can only be honed by experience. "
        "Passes that look open to them often are not because they do not have the experience to know "
        "how long it takes to get from point A to point B and bad passes are often a result of slow "
        "recognition. In either case, negative reinforcement of the attempted pass often results in "
        "a reluctance to make the next pass. The long term effect could be a player who does not "
        "understand the value of passing and takes no joy in it.
        \n\nTYPES OF PASSES
        \nThere are essentially two types of passes:
        \nAir Pass - The pass travels between players without hitting the floor.
        \nBounce Passes - The pass is thrown to the floor so that it bounces to the intended receiver
        \nEach type of pass comes with its own variations.
        \n\nBasic Variations:
        \n\n- Chest Pass
        \n\n- Bounce Pass
        \n\n- Overhead Pass
        \n\n- Wrap Around Pass
        \n\nAdvanced Variations:
        \n\n- Baseball Pass
        \n\n- Dribble Pass
        \n\n- Behind-the-Back Pass
        \n\n- Pick and Roll Pass
        \n\nTEACHING POINTS
        \nWhen teaching passing, points of emphasis should be:
        \n\nA good pass is a pass a teammate can catch
        \nWhen passing, step toward your receiver.
        \nWhen catching, step toward the pass
        \nLike shooting, the ball should have a backspin to it. This is accomplished by following "
        "through on every pass.
        \n\nBasic Passes
        \n\nCHEST PASS
        \nThe chest pass is named so because the pass originates from the chest. It is thrown by "
        "gripping the ball on the sides with the thumbs directly behind the ball. When the pass is "
        "thrown, the fingers are rotated behind the ball and the thumbs are turned down. The resulting "
        "follow through has the back of the hands facing one another with the thumbs straight down. "
        "The ball should have a nice backspin.
        \nWhen throwing a chest pass, the players should strive to throw it to the receiver's chest "
        "level. Passes that go low to high or high to low are difficult to catch.
        \n\nBOUNCE PASS
        \nThe bounce pass is thrown with the same motion however it is aimed at the floor. It should "
        "be thrown far enough out that the ball bounces waist high to the receiver. Some say try to "
        "throw it 3/4 of the way to the receiver, and that may be a good reference point to start, "
        "but each player has to experiment how far to throw it so it bounces to the receiver properly. "
        "Putting a proper and consistent backspin on the pass will make the distance easier to judge.
        \n\nOVERHEAD PASS
        \nThe overhead pass is often used as an outlet pass. Bring the ball directly above your "
        "forehead with both hands on the side of the ball and follow through. Aim for the teammate's "
        "chin. Some coaches advise not bring the ball behind your head, because it can get stolen "
        "and it takes a split-second longer to throw the pass.
        \n\nWRAP AROUND PASS
        \nStep around the defense with your non-pivot foot. Pass the ball with one hand (outside hand). "
        "It can be used as an air or a bounce pass. You will often see the wrap-around, air pass on "
        "the perimeter and the wrap-around, bounce pass to make an entry into the post.
        \n\nAdvanced Passes
        \n\nBASEBALL PASS
        \nA baseball pass is a one-handed pass that uses the same motion as a baseball throw. This "
        "is often used to make long passes. Be careful with young kids. You don't want them throw "
        "their arms out.
        \n\nDRIBBLE PASS
        \nThe dribble pass is used to quickly pass the ball with one hand off of the dribble. This "
        "can be an air or bounce pass. You'll see Steve Nash do this all of the time.
        \n\nBEHIND-THE-BACK PASS
        \nA behind-the-back pass is when you wrap the ball around your back to throw the ball. It is "
        "used to avoid the defender when making a pass across the front of you would be risky. It "
        "can also be used to throw the ball to a player trailing on the fast break.
        \nI would not recommend to use this pass during a game until heavily practiced.
        \n\nPICK AND ROLL PASS
        \nThis is a pass that is used when the defenders double-team or switch on the pick and roll. "
        "If dribbling to the right, your left side is facing the target and you bring the ball up "
        "from your right side to throw the ball overhead to the screener who has either rolled to "
        "the basket or popped to the perimeter. The pass is used to shield the ball from the defender, "
        "and many times is thrown in "hook shot" fashion. Advanced players can do this while slightly "
        "fading away from the defender. "</string>

    <string name="subject_3_title_tv">"DEFENSE:"</string>
    <string name="subject_3_subTitle">"Shut Them Down"</string>

    <string name="subject_3_description_tv" formatted="false">"It doesn't matter if you play zone, man to man, or press...
        \nContesting shots can greatly improve your defense!
        \nNotice, that I'm saying "contesting" and NOT "blocking." I believe teaching players to "
        "block shots can form bad habits, and most players do not have the ability to consistently "
        "block shots without hurting the team's defense.
        \n\nHere are some tips to Contesting Shots:
        \nClose out fast and under control. If you close out too fast, a smart player will blow by you. "
        "You can also end up fouling the shooter if you can not stop your momentum.
        \nExtend your arm and hand up as high you can. Sometimes, players like to put their hands in "
        "front of the offensive player's eyes to disrupt their vision.
        \nNever Leave Your Feet. This can lead to a number of problems. An offensive player can draw "
        "the foul or drive by you. It can also put you in terrible rebounding position.
        \nI recently read an old article in a Winning Hoops newsletter where a coach did a study on "
        "5 basketball games. It included games of Cincinnati v North Carolina, Temple v Kansas, "
        "Michigan State v Louisville, Kentucky v Indiana, and Maryland v Oklahoma.
        \nIn the article, he recorded that..
        \nNON-contested shots made 58.4% of their shots.
        \nContested shots only made 33.6% of their shots.
        \nThat's a 25% difference!
        \nContesting shots is not the only factor (rebounding, turnovers, and so on) that determines "
        "a win or loss, but it certainly is a critical one.
        \n\nMan-to-Man Defense - Keeping pressure on the ball, on-ball defense.
        \nWe want defensive pressure on the ball at all times. This will cause offensive turnovers "
        "and give their outside shooters difficulty getting the shot off.
        \nAssume the stance described above, forcing toward the baseline, and focus on the belly-button. "
        "Don't get your feet crossed unless you have to sprint back. Avoid "reaching-in" and taking "
        "a swipe at the ball, as this causes the defender to lose his/her balance and defensive stance "
        "and the offensive player can now beat him/her off the dribble. Reaching-in also leads to "
        "fouls. Keeping pressure on the outside harasses the offensive player and makes it difficult "
        "for him/her to see the floor and his/her teammates.
        \nAn important part of denying that pass into the low post is keeping pressure on the ball, "
        "so that it is really difficult to make that pass. But won't playing up tight on the ball-handler "
        "allow him/her to beat the defender with a dribble move? Yes and no... read about "help and recover" "
        "below.
        \nThe principle of help and recover is very important in denying dribble-penetration, once "
        "again pointing out that man-to-man defense is a "team defense", not just individual man-on-man. "
        "Also, our helpside low defenders should be in position to stop dribble-penetration, but at "
        "the risk of leaving an unguarded low post player... so we must teach our outside defenders "
        "how to work together with help and recover to keep the ball outside."</string>

    <string name="subject_4_title_tv">"REBOUNDING"</string>
    <string name="subject_4_subTitle">"Who Wants It More"</string>

    <string name="subject_4_description_tv" formatted="false">"How to Improve Basketball Rebounding:  Tips, Drills and Fundamentals
        \nFew statistics influence the outcome of the game as do rebounding stats. Few statistics "
        "are indicators of as many things as are rebounding stats. Few actions affect more parts of "
        "the game as rebounding.
        \n\nRebounding can be an indicator of how hard you are playing, team focus, how well you are "
        "shooting, etc. The other benefits are rewards for playing good defense by getting the ball "
        "off the defensive glass and lay-ups for grabbing offensive rebounds. Both situation feed "
        "your confidence and allow you to play better.
        \nJust how important is rebounding to your team's success? It's critical and here's why:
        \nFor starters, very few teams make 50% of their first shot attempts. If you were to actually "
        "study that, you will see that, at the very highest level (NBA) teams are in the 43% range. "
        "As you move down, through college and then to high school you will notice that the percentages "
        "go down to the mid 30's. Keep in mind that we are talking about 1st shots. Teams that "
        "consistently shoot near the 50% range are usually good in 2 areas, making lay-ups and getting "
        "offensive rebounds that turn into made lay-ups.
        \nAnother thing to consider is that every rebound is a possession. If you get a defensive "
        "rebound, that gives you a possession and a chance to score on the other end. If you shoot, "
        "miss and get the offensive rebound, you have is an additional possession in which you have "
        "a chance to score. Most importantly, it is an additional possession that you have gained "
        "without the other team having a chance to score.
        \nNumber of possessions is a very important reference point. The more possessions you have "
        "the less efficient you have to be on offense, the lower shooting percentage you have to have "
        "to attain the same number of points. It is more probable you will  get 40 points by shooting "
        "20 for 50 (40%) than the same number of points by shooting 20 for 40 (50%). If you shoot 20 "
        "for 60 (33%) you will still have 40 points. Shooting 20 for 30 (66%) still gives you 40 points "
        "but doesn't happen very often.
        \nAm I saying that it is better to shoot lower percentages? Certainly not. I am saying that "
        "it happens more often and it is more practical to practice and plan for missed shots because "
        "they usually happen more often than made shots. It is what happens to those missed shots that "
        "give you additional possessions, possessions that give you an opportunity to score while "
        "robbing your opponent of the same opportunity.
        \nThat is what decides games.
        \n\nHow Do We Become Good Rebounders?
        \n\nI think there are 3 things that lead to good rebounding:
        \n\nKnowledge
        \n\nSkill
        \n\nDetermination
        \n\nNotice that nowhere in those 3 aspects is the size or strength. I am not saying that "
        "doesn't help but think about this, Paul Silas, at 6\'6 didn't become one of the greatest "
        "offensive rebounders of all time because of his size. There were plenty of 6\'6 players "
        "around but they could not do what Silas did. Bill Russell didn't become one of the greatest "
        "rebounders of all time because he was 6\'9. There were plenty of bigger and stronger players "
        "around but they couldn't do what Russell could. Another, more current example would be Udonis "
        "Haslem of the Miami Heat. At 6\'8, Haslem is drastically undersized to play power forward "
        "in the NBA. Yet, for the past 3 years he has been a leader in rebounds per minutes played.
        \nHow do they accomplish what they do?
        \n\nKnowledge 
        \nGood rebounders understand the game and personnel. They study who shoots, when and from " 
        "where. I know that might be difficult when playing an opponent you have not seen " 
        "before, but tendencies become apparent as the game unfolds. Be that as it may, there is no " 
        "reason you can't study your own teammates. If you know Joey likes to shoot the ball from " 
        "the right corner, instead of working on something that is going to be non-productive, get " 
        "yourself in a position to rebound when Joey gets the ball in the right corner. That is "
         "preparation that will allow you to overcome most players you have to rebound against. 
        \nThe next thing good rebounders understand is where the ball will go. Shots taken from the "
         "wing down to the baseline rebound back at the same angle or over at an opposite angle 80% " 
        "of the time. Only 20% of shots rebound to the front of the rim.
         \nShots taken above the foul line extended to the top of the key rebound 60% to the sides "
         "and 40% to the front of the rim. Good rebounders are proactive. Study where the shots come " 
        "from and react accordingly before the ball misses. You might miss a few but you will get a lot. 
        \n\nGood rebounders also understand that a long shot often produces a long rebound. Not always, " 
        "but you have to play percentages. How long will the rebound be? Well that would be purely a "
         "guess. However, while we understand that being close to the rim is good for rebounding, you " 
        "can be too close. Assume that EVERY shot will be a long rebound and position yourself as such. " 
        "A good guide for position is the NBA charge/block arc in the lane. That is about the area you "
         "want to get to on a missed shot.
        \n\nSkill
         \nThe skills of rebounding are simple: prepare your hands, block out, catch the ball. As " 
        "simple as it sounds, these are skills that have to be practiced.
         \n\nDrill To Get Your Hands Up 
        \n\nMcHale Taps 
        \nOn the right side of the backboard, jump and dribble the ball off the backboard with your " 
        "right hand. Time your jump so you dribble the ball while you are in the air. Pick a spot on "
         "the backboard to dribble at so you are not just batting the ball up. Do not bounce between " 
        "dribbles, each jump is a dribble. With each dribble with your right hand, touch the rim with " 
        "your left hand. If you can't get the rim, try to get the net.

         \n\nBangs 
        \nStart on the right side. Grab the ball with 2 hands, jump and bang the ball on the backboard, " 
        "as hard as you can, 3 times. On the 4th jump, put the ball in the basket. If you can't get " 
        "the backboard, use the wall. 
        \nChange sides. 
        \nWork up to 20 bangs 
        \nKeep the ball over your head. No rest or winding up between jumps.

        \n\nDetermination
        \nWhile the shortest distance between 2 points might be a straight line, the same cannot be " 
        "said of a rebound. While you can play the odds (see knowledge), trying to predict where a " 
        "rebound will carom is like predicting how a football will roll after landing on its point. " 
        "Balls hit hands, hits the rim multiple times, players are pushed out of position, there are " 
        "2nd and 3rd chances when you did not think you had one chance. You have to condition yourself "
         "that you can get every rebound and go after it again and again until you grab it.
        \n\nBoxing Out
         \nBoxing on a rebound is very important. However, it is not as important as getting the ball. " 
        "Boxing is a momentary action intended to impede the path of an opponent and delay his ability "
         "to go after the ball. I have seen many games lost due to a great box out but nobody went " 
        "after the ball. 
        \nIn addition, boxing out is a confusing term. Previously we discussed rebounding position " 
        "(around the NBA block/charge line). What would you do if your opponent is inside of you in "
         "that rebounding position? You can't box him out because he is inside of you. I would box " 
        "him in, turn and push him toward the basket. What if you are under the basket with your " 
        "defender on your back? Would you box him out into good rebounding position? I would turn " 
        "and box him in, under the basket. 
        \nWhen boxing out, find your man as soon as a shot goes up. Pivot in the most comfortable " 
        "and efficient way you can, into an athletic position that looks like you are sitting on a " 
        "chair. Immediately your arms go up, your elbows go out and your hands get ready to grab " 
        "the ball. We discussed above the reasons for getting your arms up and hands ready (see skills). " 
        "The purpose for getting your elbows out is NOT to hit anyone, but it does make you wider "
         "and more difficult to go around. In this position, bump your man with your butt and then "
         "go after the ball.
         \nBoxing out (or in) is not only a defensive maneuver but can be an offensive maneuver as " 
        "well. Use it any time you are in position to do so. Be aggressive and take control of the "
         "situation. Don't wait for your man to make a move, go and get him before he has a chance "
         "to move.
         \nRemember, to be a good rebounder or a good rebounding team doesn't necessarily mean you " 
        "get every rebound, just be sure your opponent doesn't get it.
        \n\nThe Truth About Rebounding
        \nTechnique will certainly help any rebounder, however rebounding is one area in basketball "
        "where you can excel with out technique. True greatness in rebounding, either as an individual "
        "or as a team lies in the emphasis and the value you place on it.
        \nJim Calhoun, the great coach at the University of Connecticut, says you should be able to "
        "walk into a practice and within 15 minutes you should be able to figure out what is important "
        "to the coach and the team. If you look at his teams, going all the way back to his days at "
        "Boston State and Northeastern, you will see that his teams are always one of the leaders "
        "in the nation in rebounding. Rebounding is a prominent feature in his offensive and defensive "
        "schemes. When you walk into his practice, it is evident immediately how important rebounding "
        "is to him and his team. In addition, one of the "Laws of Learning" is "primacy" (what is "
        "learned first is learned best). In Coach Calhoun's practices, the first drills they do every "
        "day are rebounding drills.
        \nIf you want to be great rebounders, learn from that."</string>
